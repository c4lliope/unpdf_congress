10                ditions; or

11                    (ii) any other comparable objective

 3                fully insured commercial book of business

 4                for all major medical products and the total

 5                value of all fees charged by the issuer and

22                issuer’s contribution amount for any cal-

23                endar year under clause (iii) reflects its

24                proportionate share of an additional

23      (a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following findings:

24           (1) N GENERAL  .—The individual responsibility

25      requirement provided for in this section (in this sub-

      HR 3590 EAS/PP
                            318

 1       section referred to as the ‘‘requirement’’) is commer-

 2       cial and economic in nature, and substantially affects

 3       interstate commerce, as a result of the effects described
 4       in paragraph (2).

 5           (2) E FFECTS ON THE NATIONAL ECONOMY AND

 6       INTERSTATE  COMMERCE   .—The effects described in

 7       this paragraph are the following:

 8                (A) The requirement regulates activity that

 9           is commercial and economic in nature: economic

10           and financial decisions about how and when

11           health care is paid for, and when health insur-

12           ance is purchased.

13                (B) Health insurance and health care serv-

14           ices are a significant part of the national econ-
15           omy. National health spending is projected to in-

16           crease from $2,500,000,000,000, or 17.6 percent

17           of the economy, in 2009 to $4,700,000,000,000 in

18           2019. Private health insurance spending is pro-

19           jected to be $854,000,000,000 in 2009, and pays

20           for medical supplies, drugs, and equipment that

21           are shipped in interstate commerce. Since most

22           health insurance is sold by national or regional

23           health insurance companies, health insurance is

24           sold in interstate commerce and claims pay-
25           ments flow through interstate commerce.

                            319

 1                (C) The requirement, together with the other

 2           provisions of this Act, will add millions of new
 3           consumers to the health insurance market, in-

 4           creasing the supply of, and demand for, health

 5           care services. According to the Congressional

 6           Budget Office, the requirement will increase the

 7           number and share of Americans who are insured.

 8                (D) The requirement achieves near-uni-

 9           versal coverage by building upon and strength-
10           ening the private employer-based health insur-

11           ance system, which covers 176,000,000 Ameri-

12           cans nationwide. In Massachusetts, a similar re-

13           quirement has strengthened private employer-

14           based coverage: despite the economic downturn,

15           the number of workers offered employer-based

16           coverage has actually increased.

17                (E) Half of all personal bankruptcies are
18           caused in part by medical expenses. By signifi-

19           cantly increasing health insurance coverage, the

20           requirement, together with the other provisions of

21           this Act, will improve financial security for fam-

22           ilies.

23                (F) Under the Employee Retirement Income

24           Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.),

25           the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et


      HR 3590 EAS/PP
                            320

 1           seq.), and this Act, the Federal Government has

 2           a significant role in regulating health insurance
 3           which is in interstate commerce.

 4                (G) Under sections 2704 and 2705 of the

 5           Public Health Service Act (as added by section

 6           1201 of this Act), if there were no requirement,

 7           many individuals would wait to purchase health

 8           insurance until they needed care. By signifi-

 9           cantly increasing health insurance coverage, the
10           requirement, together with the other provisions of

 6  SEC. 2406. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING LONG-TERM

 7               CARE.

 8       (a) FINDINGS.—The Senate makes the following find-

 9 ings:

10           (1) Nearly 2 decades have passed since Congress

11       seriously considered long-term care reform. The

12       United States Bipartisan Commission on Comprehen-

13       sive Health Care, also know as the ‘‘Pepper Commis-

14       sion’’, released its ‘‘Call for Action’’ blueprint for
15       health reform in September 1990. In the 20 years

16       since those recommendations were made, Congress has

17       never acted on the report.

18           (2) In 1999, under the United States Supreme

19       Court’s decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581

20       (1999), individuals with disabilities have the right to

21       choose to receive their long-term services and supports

22       in the community, rather than in an institutional

23       setting.

24           (3) Despite the Pepper Commission and
25       Olmstead decision, the long-term care provided to our



      HR 3590 EAS/PP
                             486

 1       Nation’s elderly and disabled has not improved. In

 2       fact, for many, it has gotten far worse.

 3            (4) In 2007, 69 percent of Medicaid long-term
 4       care spending for elderly individuals and adults with

 5       physical disabilities paid for institutional services.

 6       Only 6 states spent 50 percent or more of their Med-

 7       icaid long-term care dollars on home and community-

 8       based services for elderly individuals and adults with

 9       physical disabilities while⁄2 of the States spent less

10       than 25 percent. This disparity continues even

11       though, on average, it is estimated that Medicaid dol-

12       lars can support nearly 3 elderly individuals and

13       adults with physical disabilities in home and commu-

14       nity-based services for every individual in a nursing
15       home. Although every State has chosen to provide cer-

16       tain services under home and community-based waiv-

17       ers, these services are unevenly available within and

18       across States, and reach a small percentage of eligible

19       individuals.

20       (b) SENSE OF THE  SENATE  .—It is the sense of the Sen-

21 ate that—

22            (1) during the 111th session of Congress, Con-

23       gress should address long-term services and supports

24       in a comprehensive way that guarantees elderly and
25       disabled individuals the care they need; and



      HR 3590 EAS/PP
                         487

 1          (2) long term services and supports should be

 2      made available in the community in addition to in

 3      institutions.

 6       Medicaid programs selected to participate, as deter-

 6      requiring post-acute care are appropriately placed in,

 7      or have ready access to, post-acute care settings.

 8           (6) The Secretary and each State selected to par-

 9      ticipate in the demonstration project shall ensure that

10      the demonstration project does not result in the Med-

11      icaid beneficiaries whose care is subject to payment

12      under the demonstration project being provided with

13      less items and services for which medical assistance is

14      provided under the State Medicaid program than the
15      items and services for which medical assistance would

16      have been provided to such beneficiaries under the

17      State Medicaid program in the absence of the dem-

14      ical errors, encouraging the efficient resolution of dis-

15      putes, increasing the availability of prompt and fair

16      resolution of disputes, and improving access to liabil-

17      ity insurance, while preserving an individual’s right
18      to seek redress in court; and

17           other provisions of this Act, will add millions of

 1           cans nationwide. In Massachusetts, a similar re-

 2           quirement has strengthened private employer-
 3           based coverage: despite the economic downturn,

 4           the number of workers offered employer-based

 5           coverage has actually increased.

 6                ‘‘(E) The economy loses up to

 7           $207,000,000,000 a year because of the poorer

 8           health and shorter lifespan of the uninsured. By

 9           significantly reducing the number of the unin-
10           sured, the requirement, together with the other

11           provisions of this Act, will significantly reduce

12           this economic cost.

13                ‘‘(F) The cost of providing uncompensated

14           care to the uninsured was $43,000,000,000 in

15           2008. To pay for this cost, health care providers

16           pass on the cost to private insurers, which pass

17           on the cost to families. This cost-shifting in-
18           creases family premiums by on average over

19           $1,000 a year. By significantly reducing the

20           number of the uninsured, the requirement, to-

21           gether with the other provisions of this Act, will

22           lower health insurance premiums.

 8           ment has a significant role in regulating health

 9           insurance. The requirement is an essential part
10           of this larger regulation of economic activity,

11           and the absence of the requirement would under-

12           cut Federal regulation of the health insurance

16           1201 of this Act), if there were no requirement,

17           many individuals would wait to purchase health
18           insurance until they needed care. By signifi-

19           cantly increasing health insurance coverage, the

20           requirement, together with the other provisions of

21           this Act, will minimize this adverse selection and

22           broaden the health insurance risk pool to include

23           healthy individuals, which will lower health in-

 8           cantly increasing health insurance coverage and

10           economies of scale, the requirement, together with

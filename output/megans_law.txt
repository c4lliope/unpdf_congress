 4       was abducted, sexually assaulted, and murdered in

 5       1994, in the State of New Jersey by a violent pred-

 6       ator living across the street from her home. Unbe-

 7       knownst to Megan Kanka and her family, he had been

 8       convicted previously of a sex offense against a child.

 9             (2) In 1996, Congress adopted Megan’s Law

10       (Public Law 104–145) as a means to encourage

11       States to protect children by identifying the where-

12       abouts of sex offenders and providing the means to

13       monitor their activities.

14             (3) In 2006, Congress passed the Adam Walsh

15       Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Public Law

16       109–248) to protect children and the public at large

17       by establishing a comprehensive national system for

18       the registration and notification to the public and

19       law enforcement officers of convicted sex offenders.

10       els to a foreign country and engages in sexual activity

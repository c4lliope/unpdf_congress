 5              UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESO-

 6              LUTIONS AND FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS ON

 7              NORTH KOREA.

 8      (a) FINDINGS .—Congress makes the following findings:
 9           (1) All member states of the United Nations are

10      obligated to implement and enforce applicable United

11      Nations Security Council resolutions fully and

12      promptly, including by blocking the property of, and

13      ensuring that any property is prevented from being

14      made available to, persons designated for the blocking

15      of property by the Security Council under applicable

16      United Nations Security Council resolutions.

17           (2) As of May 2015, 158 of the 193 member

18      states of the United Nations had not submitted re-
19      ports on measures taken to implement North Korea-

20      specific United Nations Security Council resolutions

21      1718, 1874, and 2094.

22           (3) A recent report by the Government Account-

23      ability Office (GAO–15–485)—

24               (A) finds that officials of the United States

25           and representatives of the United Nations Panel


      †HR 757 EAS
                             30

 1           of Experts established pursuant to United Na-

 2           tions Security Council Resolution 1874 (2009),

 3           which monitors and facilitates implementation

 4           of United Nations sanctions on North Korea,

 5           ‘‘agree that the lack of detailed reports from all
 6           member states is an impediment to the UN’s ef-

 7           fective implementation of its sanctions’’; and

 8                (B) notes that ‘‘many member states lack

 9           the technical capacity to enforce sanctions and

10           prepare reports’’ on the implementation of

11           United Nations sanctions on North Korea.

12           (4) All member states share a common interest

13       in protecting the international financial system from
14       the risks of money laundering and illicit transactions

15       emanating from North Korea.

16           (5) The United States dollar and the euro are the

17       world’s principal reserve currencies, and the United

18       States and the European Union are primarily re-

19       sponsible for the protection of the international finan-

20       cial system from the risks described in paragraph (4).

21           (6) The cooperation of the People’s Republic of
22       China, as North Korea’s principal trading partner, is

23       essential to—

24                (A) the enforcement of applicable United

25           Nations Security Council resolutions; and

                             31

 1                (B) the protection of the international fi-

 2           nancial system.

 3           (7) The report of the Panel of Experts expressed

 4       concern about the ability of banks to detect and pre-

 5       vent illicit transfers involving North Korea if such
 6       banks are located in member states with less effective

 7       regulators or member states that are unable to afford

 8       effective compliance.

 9           (8) North Korea has historically exploited incon-

10       sistencies between jurisdictions in the interpretation

11       and enforcement of financial regulations and applica-

12       ble United Nations Security Council resolutions to

13       circumvent sanctions and launder the proceeds of il-
14       licit activities.

15           (9) Amroggang Development Bank, Bank of East

16       Land, and Tanchon Commercial Bank have been des-

17       ignated by the Secretary of the Treasury, the United

18       Nations Security Council, and the European Union

19       as having materially contributed to the proliferation

20       of weapons of mass destruction.

21           (10) Korea Daesong Bank and Korea Kwangson
22       Banking Corporation have been designated by the

23       Secretary of the Treasury and the European Union as

24       having materially contributed to the proliferation of

25       weapons of mass destruction.

 1           (11) The Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea

 2       has been designated by the Secretary of the Treasury

 3       for facilitating transactions on behalf of persons

 4       linked to its proliferation network and for serving as

 5       ‘‘a key financial node’’.
 6           (12) Daedong Credit Bank has been designated

 7       by the Secretary of the Treasury for activities prohib-

 8       ited by applicable United Nations Security Council

 9       resolutions, including the use of deceptive financial

10       practices to facilitate transactions on behalf of per-

11       sons linked to North Korea’s proliferation network.

12       (b) SENSE OF  CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress

13 that the President should intensify diplomatic efforts in ap-
14 propriate international fora, such as the United Nations,

15 and bilaterally, to develop and implement a coordinated,

16 consistent, multilateral strategy for protecting the global fi-

17 nancial system against risks emanating from North Korea,

18 including—

19           (1) the cessation of any financial services the

20       continuation of which is inconsistent with applicable

21       United Nations Security Council resolutions;
22           (2) the cessation of any financial services to per-

23       sons, including financial institutions, that present

24       unacceptable risks of facilitating money laundering

 1      and illicit activity by the Government of North

 2      Korea;

 3           (3) the blocking by all member states, in accord-

 4      ance with the legal process of the state in which the

 5      property is held, of any property required to be

 6      blocked under applicable United Nations Security

 7      Council resolutions;

 8           (4) the blocking of any property derived from il-

 9      licit activity, or from the misappropriation, theft, or

10      embezzlement of public funds by, or for the benefit of,

11      officials of the Government of North Korea;

12           (5) the blocking of any property involved in sig-

13      nificant activities undermining cybersecurity by the

14      Government of North Korea, directly or indirectly,

15      against United States persons, or the theft of intellec-

16      tual property by the Government of North Korea, di-

17      rectly or indirectly from United States persons; and

18           (6) the blocking of any property of persons di-

19      rectly or indirectly involved in censorship or human

20      rights abuses by the Government of North Korea.

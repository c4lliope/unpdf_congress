 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Equality Act’’.
 SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
      (a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:
          (1) Discrimination can occur on the basis of the sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or preg- nancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of an individual, as well as because of sex-based stereo- types. Each of these factors alone can serve as the basis for discrimination, and each is a form of sex discrimination.
          (2) A single instance of discrimination may have more than 1 basis. For example, discrimination against a married same-sex couple could be based on the sex stereotype that marriage should only be be- tween heterosexual couples, the sexual orientation of the 2 individuals in the couple, or both. Discrimina- tion against a pregnant lesbian could be based on her sex, her sexual orientation, her pregnancy, or on the basis of multiple factors.
          (3) Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (re- ferred to as ‘‘LGBT’’) people commonly experience discrimination in securing access to public accom- modations—including restaurants, stores, places of or establishments that provide entertainment, and transportation. Forms of discrimination include the exclusion and denial of entry, unequal or unfair treatment, harassment, and violence. This discrimi- nation prevents the full participation of LGBT peo- ple in society and disrupts the free flow of com- merce.
          (4) Women also face discrimination, in estab- lishments such as stores and restaurants, and places or establishments that provide other goods or serv- ices, such as entertainment or transportation, in- cluding sexual harassment, differential pricing, and denial of services because they are pregnant or breastfeeding.
          (5) Regular and ongoing discrimination against LGBT people, as well as women, in accessing public accommodations contributes to negative social and economic outcomes.
          (6) The discredited practice known as ‘‘conver- sion therapy’’ is a form of discrimination that harms LGBT people by undermining individuals sense of self worth, increasing suicide ideation and substance abuse, exacerbating family conflict, and contributing to second class status.
          (7) Both LGBT people and women face wide- spread discrimination in employment and various services, including by entities that receive Federal fi- nancial assistance. Such discrimination—
               (A) is particularly troubling and inappro- priate for programs and services funded wholly or in part by the Federal Government;
               (B) undermines national progress toward equal treatment regardless of sex, sexual ori- entation, or gender identity; and
               (C) is inconsistent with the constitutional principle of equal protection under the Four- teenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.
          (8) Workers who are LGBT, or are perceived to be LGBT, have been subjected to a history and pat- tern of persistent, widespread, and pervasive dis- crimination on the bases of sexual orientation and gender identity by private sector employers and Fed- eral, State, and local government employers.
          (9) Numerous provisions of Federal law ex- pressly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, and Federal agencies and courts have correctly in- terpreted these prohibitions on sex discrimination to include discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex stereotypes. In particular, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission correctly interpreted title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in Macy v. Holder , Baldwin v. Foxx , and Lusardi v. McHugh.
          (10) The absence of explicit prohibitions of dis- crimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity under Federal statutory law, as well as the existence of legislative proposals that would have provided such explicit prohibitions, has led some courts to conclude incorrectly that current Federal laws prohibiting sex discrimination do not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual ori- entation and gender identity. It has also created un- certainty for employers and other entities covered by Federal nondiscrimination laws and caused unneces- sary hardships for LGBT individuals.
          (11) LGBT people often face discrimination when seeking to rent or purchase housing, as well as in every other aspect of obtaining and maintaining housing. LGBT people in same-sex relationships are often discriminated against when 2 names associated with 1 gender appear on a housing application, and transgender people often encounter discrimination when credit checks or inquiries reveal a former name.
          (12) National surveys, including a study com- missioned by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, show that housing discrimination against LGBT people is very prevalent. For in- stance, when same-sex couples inquire about housing that is available for rent, they are less likely to re- ceive positive responses from landlords. According to other studies, transgender people have half the homeownership rate of non-transgender people and about 1 in 5 transgender people experience home- lessness.
          (13) As a result of the absence of explicit prohi- bitions against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, credit applicants who are LGBT, or perceived to be LGBT, have un- equal opportunities to establish credit. LGBT people can experience being denied a mortgage, credit card, student loan, or many other types of credit simply because of their sexual orientation or gender iden- tity.
          (14) Numerous studies demonstrate that LGBT people, especially transgender people and women, are economically disadvantaged and at a higher risk for poverty compared with other groups of people.
          (15) The right to an impartial jury of one’s peers and the reciprocal right to jury service are fundamental to the free and democratic system of justice in the United States and are based in the Bill of Rights. There is, however, an unfortunate and long-documented history in the United States of attorneys discriminating against LGBT individuals, or those perceived to be LGBT, in jury selection. Failure to bar peremptory challenges based on the actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity of an individual not only erodes a funda- mental right, duty, and obligation of being a citizen of the United States, but also unfairly creates a sec- ond class of citizenship for LGBT victims, witnesses, plaintiffs, and defendants.
     (b) P URPOSE .—It is the purpose of this Act to ex- pand as well as clarify, confirm and create greater consist- ency in the protections against discrimination on the basis of all covered characteristics and to provide guidance and notice to individuals, organizations, corporations, and agencies regarding their obligations under the law.
